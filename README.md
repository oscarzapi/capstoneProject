### Project Title
capstone Project

**OSCAR ZAMORA**

#### Executive summary
This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), missing value analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering. It addresses class imbalance using SMOTE, missing value handling, engineered features on the dataset that can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/igorvolianiuk/loan-approval-eda-catboost-optuna/input

#### Rationale
To optimize the processing time of a loan approval and predict upcoming loan requests status based on a selected number of input features in the banking / financial sector. The analysis will serve as a backup information for the real decisions taken by an entity.

#### Research Question
Who is eligible for a loan approval?

#### Data Sources
- **train.csv** - the training dataset; loan_status is the binary target
- **test.csv** - the test dataset; the objective is to predict probability of the target loan_status for each row.

#### Methodology
Will cover the following sections: 
- Missing Value Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data preprocessing for numerical and categorical features
- Data Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- Modelling with different Regression and classifier models

#### Results
Comparison table between all models' performance to detect the best models to be used.
How providing a test dataset we can detect whether new loan requests will be approved based on the input features and the best model selected.

#### Next steps
To reduce the Business cost of these predictions by using different ML algorithms or Deep Learning approaches.
